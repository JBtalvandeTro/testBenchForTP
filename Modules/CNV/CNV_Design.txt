	- 50147TRS001-01  
	- 50147ICD001-03
	- 50147SWAD001-01
	
The CNV module manage the Functional of the POWER Core ( COMETi) state and msgs and faults

Input Data and Services : 

	- the CMD from the PTCU(MTU) (BUCK, BOOST, STOP)
	- the EMER_STOP DSI
	- the DATA from the COMETi units (Temp, Error, Measures, Control Info)
	- FSM current Mode
	
Output Data and Services :

	- Flags on the States of COMETi units
	- Sending CMD to the COMETi units 

Dependencies : 
	- MCAL :
	
	- Middleware :
	
	- App Layer :
	

Based on the SWAD the CNV management should be done every 1ms to smooth the load on the CAN internal.
